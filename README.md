HUMAN RESOURCE MACHINE  - ALL LEVELS SOLVED
===========================================

This is my collection of all levels I have solved in the game [Human Resource Machine](http://tomorrowcorporation.com/humanresourcemachine).

I try to complete every level with the two extra conditions (one is a maximum runtime, the other a maximum size), and currently I have managed this in all levels.

*Note:* There are sometimes levels with an solution for both conditions and an extra solution only for runtime. That's because, while the first meets both conditions, I found another algorithm to solve the level even faster (with the cost of increasing the operations count).

I highly recommend you to buy the game and play for yourself - only look here for ~~solutions~~ hints if you are genuinely* stuck.
